# INTRODUCTION

The radiation from ISM dust, confined within the
molecular clouds, is the source of emissions from very
cold objects: typically less than 140 K. These dust
structures obscure relatively nearby regions in visible and
UV regions and re-radiate the absorbed radiation in the
FIR region. This contributes a major part (30%) of the to-
tal luminosity of the galaxy. These FIR radiations prepon-
derate over the gravitational energy of collapsing clouds,
instigating star formations. Moreover, dust structures be-
ing responsible for the molecular dissociation and succes-
sively resulting H<sub>2</sub> molecule formation site, are crucial
in studying the chemistry of ISM. Constituting most of
the elements contributing to the cooling process, dust also
controls the temperature of the ISM. On the other hand, it
provides heat through electrons-photo-electrically ejected
from the grains i.e. cold emission of electrons. Such
dust structures are pivotal in the study of interaction phe-
nomena in the ISM.
