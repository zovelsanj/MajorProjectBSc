This is a final year Bachelor's project on stellar astrophysics aimed at studying the properties of isolated dust structures around the white dwafs.

# Introduction

The radiation from ISM dust, confined within the molecular clouds, is the source of emissions from very cold objects: typically less than 140 K. These dust
structures obscure relatively nearby regions in visible and UV regions and re-radiate the absorbed radiation in the FIR region. This contributes a major part (30%) of the total luminosity of the galaxy. These FIR radiations preponderate over the gravitational energy of collapsing clouds, instigating star formations. Moreover, dust structures being responsible for the molecular dissociation and successively resulting H<sub>2</sub> molecule formation site, are crucial in studying the chemistry of ISM. Constituting most of the elements contributing to the cooling process, dust also controls the temperature of the ISM. On the other hand, it provides heat through electrons-photo-electrically ejected from the grains i.e. cold emission of electrons. Such dust structures are pivotal in the study of interaction phenomena in the ISM.
